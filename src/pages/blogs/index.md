The "One Laptop per Child" project is a non-profit organization that aims to provide children in developing countries with access to modern technology and education. The organization believes that providing children with laptops will help bridge the digital divide and give them the opportunity to learn and explore the world around them.

One argument in favor of the "One Laptop per Child" project is that it can help improve education in developing countries. Many children in these countries do not have access to quality education, and providing them with laptops can help them learn and develop new skills. For example, the laptops can be used to access online education resources, such as educational videos and games, which can help children learn in a fun and engaging way.

Another argument in favor of the project is that it can help reduce inequality and promote social justice. Many children in developing countries do not have access to the same opportunities as children in developed countries, and providing them with laptops can help level the playing field. By giving these children access to technology, they will have the opportunity to learn and explore the world in ways that were previously unavailable to them.

A third argument in favor of the "One Laptop per Child" project is that it can help stimulate economic growth in developing countries. By providing children with access to technology, the project can help create a more educated and skilled workforce, which can drive economic growth and development. In addition, the laptops can be used to access information and resources that can help children and their families start businesses and improve their livelihoods.

There are some potential criticisms of the "One Laptop per Child" project. For example, some people may argue that providing children with laptops is not the most effective way to improve education in developing countries. Instead, they may argue that it is more important to focus on improving the quality of education in these countries, such as by providing better training for teachers and investing in educational infrastructure.

The 2020 Auditor General’s Report is a death announcement of the One-Laptop-Per-Child. Famously launched by General Paul Kagame in 2008, the project was to provide a laptop computer to every primary school child in Rwanda. After 12 years of implementation, the government discovered that the software and the hardware of the operating system were incompatible. This, after the government had already paid 99% of the cost of the project.

According to the Auditor General’s Report, the One-Laptop-Per-Child project is a loss of the taxpayers’ money. The E-Solution for integrating the software and hardware into teaching and learning was designed for the Knowledge-Based Curriculum. However, the contract for the One-Laptop-Per Child was signed during the phased-out Competency-Based Curriculum. As the Auditor General explains, the government discovered that the laptops were “incapable of accommodating the E-Solution system package.” Given the fact that the government had already paid 99 percent of the costs, this “constitutes a loss of public resources” – concludes the Auditor General. In other words, just as Kagame’s Vision 2020 of turning Rwanda into a middle-income knowledge-based economy was a complete failure, so is One-Laptop-Per-Child. Goodbye to Kagame’s delusions of grandeur.

General Paul Kagame famously launched One-Laptop-Per-Child (OLPC) on October 1, 2008. “We are going to turn the dream of all our children owning computers into reality”, proclaimed Kagame. Kagame further boasted that OLPC was “embedded in our development strategy of using ICT as an enabler of other sectors, including learning, as well as building a dynamic information technology industry.” Fast forward to 2020 – some 12 years since the famous launch, the OLPC is dead. The 2020 Auditor General’s Report is a death announcement of One-Laptop-per-Child.

In conclusion, the "One Laptop per Child" project is a noble effort that aims to improve education and reduce inequality in developing countries. By providing children with access to technology, the project can help them learn and develop new skills, and can help stimulate economic growth in these countries. While there may be some potential criticisms of the project, its potential benefits make it worth considering and supporting.
